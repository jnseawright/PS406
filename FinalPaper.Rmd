### Grant Proposal

The final project for this class is a mock grant proposal that features a research design that shows mastery of at least one cutting-edge quantitative causal inference estimator from this class. The proposal will be evaluated based on the criteria listed for the Northwestern Graduate School's [Graduate Research Grant](https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/funding/fellowships-and-grants/internal-fellowships-grants/graduate-research-grant.html), and the format must meet the rules for the ``Description of the project'' section of a proposal for that grant --- five pages, double spaced, up to three pages of references/endnotes/figures --- with the exception that it does not need to already have IRB approval.

Note that a successful proposal will not only score well on the criteria for grant review --- which is good practice for your professional future! --- but will also show mastery of at least one cutting edge causal inference estimator. I am not going to list out here which estimators are cutting edge and which are not, but you are probably best off if you use an estimator that you did not know about before this quarter.
