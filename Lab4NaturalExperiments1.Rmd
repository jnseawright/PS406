### Problem 1: Evaluate a Natural Experiment

Consider the following published natural experiment: 

Golovchenko, Yevgeniy. "Fighting propaganda with censorship: A study of the Ukrainian ban on Russian social media." The Journal of Politics 84.2 (2022): 639-654.

What kind of natural experiment is it? What are the key assumptions for a causal inference in a natural experiment of this kind? (State them in terms of the potential outcomes framework, possibly with a DAG if that would be helpful.) What evidence is provided in the article for those assumptions, and how good is it? On the basis of your answers to these questions, how credible do you think the natural experiment is as a whole?
