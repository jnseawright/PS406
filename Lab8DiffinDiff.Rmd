### Problem 1: Democracy and Education

In this analysis, I will ask you to use data from the Alvarez et al. data set on regimes and economic
performance worldwide. The data are available as aclppanel.csv, and you can also access [a codebook](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mishler/PrzeworskiCodebook.PDF).

Using these data, try to determine whether dictatorship/democracy (REG) has a positive or negative
causal effect on average education levels (EDT). Structure the analysis as a difference-in-differences setup,
and deal with any problems that arise. Describe your findings.
